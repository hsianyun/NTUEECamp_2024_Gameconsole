# __connection Project__

**This project demonstrates UART communication between two ESP32 devices. It includes functions for sending and receiving 'charArray', 'char', and 'uint8' data types, as well as functions for clearing the buffer, setting a timeout, and checking buffer availability.**
**To achieve this, the RX and TX pins of the UART are connected to GPIO16 and GPIO17 respectively.**

## Installation and Setup  
To set up the project, follow these steps:  
For windows users:step 3,4,5,6 can use gui
1. _Set up the ESP-IDF environment:_ 
   Follow the [ESP-IDF setup guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.2/esp32/get-started/index.html) for your operating system.

2. _Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:_  
    ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:${Username}/NTUEECamp_2024_Gameconsole.git #using ssh    
   cd NTUEECamp_2024_Gameconsole/Connection/connection
3. _Copy the project:_  
    copy the project in your device and open the project in your workplace
4. _Build the project:_
    ```bash
    idf.py build
5. _Flash the firmware to your ESP32:_
    ```bash
    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash

Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your serial port.

6. _Monitor the serial output using:_
    ```bash
    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor

## Project Structure
The connection Project consists of two source files and one header file written in C. The main application logic is implemented in [main.c](main/main.c), located within the main directory.<br><br> Additionally, the functionality is extended by [uartFunction.c](components/uartFunction/src/uartFunction.c) and its corresponding header file [uartFunction.h](components/uartFunction/include/uartFunction.h).<br><br>
This project utilizes ESP-IDF and is built using the CMake build system. The configuration for building the project can be found in the three CMakeLists.txt file.

The project is organized as follows:

connection/  
├── components/  
│  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; └── uartFunction/  
│      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── CMakeLists.txt

## Hardware Setup and Usage
Hardware setup:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Connect GPIO16 of the first ESP32 to GPIO17 of the second ESP32.    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Connect GPIO17 of the first ESP32 to GPIO16 of the second ESP32.    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Connect GND of both ESP32 devices together.  
Usage:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Run the program on both ESP32 devices.  
**If you want to use uartFunction in your project:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Copy the folder "uartFunction" into your "components" folder  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Ensure your CMakeLists.txt in the main directory contains "REQUIRES uartFunction"**
## Expected Output
Upon running the program, you should see the following output:

    initial bufferavaliable:80

    Received array:data try data try sign try !@#$^ &*()
    bufferavaliable after receive charArray:42

    Received num:85
    bufferavaliable after receive charArray uint8:41

    Received char:y
    bufferavaliable after receive charArray uint8 char:40

    bufferavaliable after clearBuffer:0

This output confirms that the data transmission and reception between the two ESP32 devices are functioning as expected.
